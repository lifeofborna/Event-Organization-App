# Event Organization App
This is a database application that can be used to organize various events. The idea of the project is for the user to be able to create different events and join various events.

## Features of the application:
- Users can log in or create a new user.
- Users can view public events and join them.
- Users can edit their own events.
- Users can delete an event.
- Users can comment on an event.
- Users can invite other users to private events.
- Users can participate in a private event.

## Features to be added:
- Addition of an admin panel (can delete/edit all events).
- Users can like an event or comments related to the event.
- Enhancing good data security, for example, a user can't delete another user's events or view events that are private.

You can try the application through Heroku [here](https://tsoha-eventx.herokuapp.com/).
